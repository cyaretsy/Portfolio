## Projects

### 1. [Email Usage pdf](Projects/Mini-Project-1.pdf)
This experiment investigates whether Smith College students are more likely to use certain apps depending on
the time of day. Students were asked to rate three types of apps they are most likely to use: social media,
streaming apps, and email. This project focuses specifically on email usage.
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the likelihood of email usage between different times of
day. The three time points considered are 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 4:00 PM.
