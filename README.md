If you click on the projects below, you would be led to the each project on guthub. Thank you for your interest. 

## Projects

### 1. [Email Usage pdf](Projects/Mini-Project-1.pdf)
This experiment investigates whether Smith College students are more likely to use certain apps depending on
the time of day. Students were asked to rate three types of apps they are most likely to use: social media,
streaming apps, and email. This project focuses specifically on email usage.
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the likelihood of email usage between different times of
day. The three time points considered are 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 4:00 PM.

### 2. [VAERS User Guide pdf](Projects/final-project.pdf)
In this project we created a user guide that contextualized VAERS dataset. - The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a dataset accessible via the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services HHS.gov website. According to the website, VAERS is co-sponsored by
the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
website offers three datasets contained via CSV file, all of which can be downloaded into a single Zip file;
VAERS Data, VAERS Symptoms, and VAERS Vaccine. For this user guide, we relied upon the 2020 dataset.
Datasets are accessible yearly from 1990-2023, with the last update being December 1, 2023. The webpage
includes a VAERS Data Use Guide which claims to contain “important information about VAERS from the
FDA, a brief description of VAERS, cautions on interpreting VAERS data, definitions of terms, description
of files, and list of commonly used abbreviations”.
