# Portfolio of Aspiring Data Analyst Yaretsy Castro

## Introduction
Hello, my name is Yaretsy Castro, an aspiring Data Analyst. 
I graduated from Smitb College with a B.A. in Statistical and Data Sciences. 
During my time at Smith College I colloborated in numerous projects.
Through these projects i learned to code in R and data analysis skills, such as data mining, data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualization, data modeling and more. 

If you click on the projects below, you would be led to the each project on guthub. Thank you for your interest. 

## Projects

### 1. [Email Usage pdf](Projects/Mini-Project-1.pdf)
This experiment investigates whether Smith College students are more likely to use certain apps depending on
the time of day. Students were asked to rate three types of apps they are most likely to use: social media,
streaming apps, and email. This project focuses specifically on email usage.
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the likelihood of email usage between different times of
day. The three time points considered are 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 4:00 PM.

### 2. [VAERS User Guide pdf](Projects/final-project.pdf)
In this project we created a user guide that contextualized VAERS dataset. - The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a dataset accessible via the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services HHS.gov website. According to the website, VAERS is co-sponsored by
the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
website offers three datasets contained via CSV file, all of which can be downloaded into a single Zip file;
VAERS Data, VAERS Symptoms, and VAERS Vaccine. For this user guide, we relied upon the 2020 dataset.
Datasets are accessible yearly from 1990-2023, with the last update being December 1, 2023. The webpage
includes a VAERS Data Use Guide which claims to contain “important information about VAERS from the
FDA, a brief description of VAERS, cautions on interpreting VAERS data, definitions of terms, description
of files, and list of commonly used abbreviations”.

### 3. [Telematics Data Analysis.html(must download)](Projects/Telematics-Data-101.html) | [Telematics Data Analysis.pdf](Projects/Telematics%20Data%20101.pdf)
In this experiment we create an intro guide into telematics data. - Telematics data essentially comes from the telematics system found in a vehicle’s tracking equipment. It records data that is being sent, received or stored by
the tracking system. More specifically, telematics data include data on speed, precise location (addresses or
coordinates) and time, route undertaken, safety metrics, acceleration, fuel intake, and many more. Telematics data
can also include multiple datasets that each consists of a subset of variables. Such an example will be explained
below using the data used to create this report.
